# Ecoripe Tropicals — CRA Starter

A clean Create React App structure rebuilt from the uploaded Wix HTML. Replace placeholder copy and expand components as needed.

## Quickstart
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
The app will start on http://localhost:3000

## Structure
- `src/components` — Header, Footer, Hero, ProductCard
- `src/pages` — Home, Products, Organics, About, Contact
- `src/index.css` — Global styles (responsive, accessible)
- Routing with `react-router-dom@6`

## Notes
- All Wix scripts/assets were removed. This is a clean React rebuild.
- Contact form currently **simulates** a submit success. Wire it to EmailJS, Formspree, or your backend.
- Replace placeholder text/images with approved client content.
